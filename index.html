<h1>Welcome, Ruler</h1>
Welcome to my little GitHub Page. I previously wrote a series of guides for this game specifically geared towards blind and visually impaired users and uploaded them to the audiogames.net forum, however by now they've been buried, and not everyone uses the forum. Thus, enter this site. I hope you find what you're looking for. This site is ever expanding, and I do intend to take input from the community. I look forward to building something great.
